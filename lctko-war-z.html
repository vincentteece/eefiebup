I don't have the book with me, but from what I can recall my favorites were the Chinese doctor (first story), the blind Japanese man, and the mentally disabled young girl. Edit: Thank you all so much for your input. If I fail my organic chemistry exam tomorrow. well then it was worth it! (I will regret saying this tomorrow). I enjoyed the movie.

Instead we got Dawn of the Dead 2: Dead faster. Utterly disappointed that this property got turned into THAT movie. I know this film gets hated on because it is not the book, and the book is great (and of course, like everyone always says, would make for the perfect HBO anthology series), but if you take a step back from the book and just view the movie as a movie, it's actually pretty solid.

The game was struggling to peak at 10k viewers only 3 days after release, so the developers resorted to paying Shroud who brought in 30k additional viewers. Considering how this particular game is being followed with interest because of certain comments Sergey Galyonkin made, I thought that it's important to know that big spikes in viewership for it are always - NFO (https://predb.pw/view.php?id=d0EzSkF4czFWUDNiOXptWXRLbGxteXdsNm40VzRJNzZRUjRZbUJqaytmOD0=) ^^23.11GB - NFO (Image) (https://i.imgur.com/sfAtxWB.png) - Wold War Z On Microsoft Store (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/world-war-z/bs17cj1g9n42?activetab=pivot:overviewtab). </p>
