                            <p>#EDIT: For anyone who happens to stumble upon this thread with the same issue, I was able to fix it by using Parted Magic . Backed up my data, used Rufus to mount the Parted Magic ISO to a USB, restarted the PC with the messed up SSD hooked up, booted it with UFEI, secured erased and sanitized the disk. This finally allowed me to do a clean install of windows. I had just received my RMA number and was about to ship it too. Best  I ever spent. ------------- Issue (my USB Linux system had to be reinstalled) I'm trying to automate the process for speed but there have been problems. 1. You can boot(GRUB) via old CD/DVD but the /install.amd/initrd.gz does not contain the iso-scan.xxx (https://iso-scan.xxx) program - therefore you can't automount a file system to /hd-media and feed debian-installer a pre-seed.cfg file which contains answers to the numerous questions an installer asks you for. Additionally your ISO/ folder will not be mounted. However. I want to add some .iso files to my grub menu and I find it more problematic than expected. When googling, I keep finding methods how to add bootable Linux iso images, but pretty much nothing about other kinds. amp#x200B; I would like to add things like: \- a Macrium Reflect restore.iso to create/restore partition images to/from a secondary hard drive (I find it better for my needs than Clonezilla because it's easier to browse the images without restoring them first) \- Hiren's Alright, so I recently got a new laptop for school and opted for a System 76 one. Since I'm a design major, I unfortunately am locked into Adobe software for at least 2 more years, plus I need to at least maintain proficiency with said software in order to remain marketable. Tomorrow (or, today rather, since its now 1AM) I'm helping out at a summer camp for kids with disabilities, and one of the plans was to help with editing and use my shiny new laptop. Of course, my first mistake 
Originally, I booted up my PC last week, and got stuck in the “Automatic Repair couldn’t repair your PC” loop. Through the Advanced Options on that Automatic Repair screen (I’ll note that the recovery options provided through the Advanced Options did not work for me, which is why I had to start running commands, which I’m not very comfortable with) I was stuck on, I was able to access the console, so I performed some Google magic on my phone and found a bunch of commands to run. I’ll Hi there, thanks in advance! So my company has two identical Pressbrake machines side by side. They run off of Windows NT 4.0 workstation. One of the HDDs on the machines had a catastrophic failure (the drive itself was from 1996 and had 0 maintenance in 20 years) and it rendered that machine unusable. Originally I purchased a new IDE hdd with the intention of installing Win NT 4.0 onto it via an external enclosure. Well that proved to not be possible, so I came here looking for advice. All right friends, I've got a bit of a conundrum. I have Debian testing installed as my main operating system. It's on a 600 GB partition, a bit of swap in logical, with about 130 GB free and unused at the end of the drive. What I'd like to do is install Debian stable (Squeeze) on another partition. Here's the thing: 1. I can't do it from a chroot because I need to fuss with the logical partition that currently contains active swap. 2. I'd like to actually run the Debian installer. 3. EVERY. I got this from , but the website is now down. I just wanted to preserve the info as it has worked well for me. Some of the comments were useful too so I am including them. Windows 7 + TrueCrypt 7.1a and Debian wheezy + encryption dual-boot with GRUB2 28 April 2013, 11:51 pm Getting Windows 7 (or Windows 8 or Windows Vista) with TrueCrypt to play nicely with GRUB2 is quite a chore. Although, after 2 days of fighting, I finally found a simple solution. (/solved) Update: I had previously been using the Windows Memory Diagnostic to test my memory, and decided to run Memtest86+ off of Hiren's Boot CD as a last ditch effort to check memory. I got a bunch of errors and was able to isolate the errors to a single stick of memory. I then reformatted and reinstalled my operating system, and everything seems to be working just fine now. I figured out a couple things: The trouble I was having with my optical drive ("pmagic_6.7.sqfs file cannot. Im looking for advice/confirmation regarding my Lenovo u400 laptop, which started having issues after upgrading from Windows 7 to 8.1 (its been a couple years since the upgrade). After i upgraded, my dedicated graphics card went kaput and windows automagitically prevented it from running as it was preventing my syestem from running. After that though it ran great and i was able to run photoshop, illustrator, a browser, and indesign simultaneously. I would always remove the back cover and spray.

I hit space bar to attempt to delete the hibernation file and start fresh but no go there as well. I used ultimate boot CD ( and ran HDD tests and it passed the tests. I tried using parted magic to reformat the drive, but I know nothing about. </p>
